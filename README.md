# Writing vim plugins in Lua

With recent updates to Neovim and Vim. It is now easy to write a vim plugins in
lua. This repo will hopefully be a book which teaches you how to write a vim plugin.

While I have created multiple vim plugins in pure Vim script such as
[asyncomplete.vim](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/asyncomplete.vim),
[vim-lsp](https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp) there are a lot more plugins that
I would like to create. But due to the limited time I do not get the luxury to
work on it most of the time. Hopefully this will teach you how to create lua plugins
so I can use the plugins you create instead.

File an issue on what you would like to learn about on writing vim plugins in lua
or an idea on a vim plugin and hopefully I will be able to to help you out.
